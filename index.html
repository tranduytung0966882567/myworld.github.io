    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>This privacy policy describes how our application ("the App") handles user information.</p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection</h2>
    <p>The App does not collect, store, or share any personal or sensitive user data. No personally identifiable information, device data, or location data is collected.</p>

    <h2>2. Children</h2>
    <p>Our App is suitable for general audiences. If the App is intended for children under 13, we fully comply with Google Play’s Families Policy Requirements and do not collect any personal data from children.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App does not use any third-party SDKs that gather personal data (such as analytics, advertising SDKs, or tracking services). If any third-party services are added in future updates, this policy will be updated accordingly.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since the App does not collect user data, no personal information is stored or transmitted. We maintain strict measures to ensure the safety and integrity of the App.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Users will be notified inside the App or through an update if significant changes occur.</p>
